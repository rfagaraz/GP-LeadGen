Python script repository.

The script runs a sequence of simple functions in order to concatenate multiple *.xslx* files into one specific document.
During this process, the script will read each filename, run a regex and give the return into a new column, in order to identify which file that  belongs to.
Another regex will be ran to identify phone numbers and replace them with the same number under a prefered structure used in Call Centers.

This is run through a very rudimentary UI and compiler until I get more confortable with these tools.
